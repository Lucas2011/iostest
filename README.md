I believe that this one-month leave will provide me with the necessary time to focus on my wedding preparations and to fully enjoy this special milestone in my life. I understand that the leave may be longer than usual, and I am more than willing to use any accrued vacation or personal leave to cover a portion of this period, if required.

I would appreciate it if you could review and consider my request for leave at your earliest convenience.
I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to formally request a one-month leave of absence from [start date] to [end date] in order to make arrangements and celebrate my upcoming wedding.   I plan to host my wedding on 08/25/2023 - 09/26/2023 in China.

Can I have a one-month leave or I wanna check with you if there is any flexibility that I can work remotely for a specific duration, coinciding with my wedding ceremony? I understand that this may not be a conventional request, but I would greatly appreciate your understanding and support during this important and joyous milestone in my life.



I want to assure you that even though I will be working remotely, I am fully committed to meeting all my deliverables and maintaining productivity during this period without access to the remote setup. I will ensure that I have a stable internet connection and all the necessary tools to perform my tasks efficiently. I will also be available for any team meetings or discussions via video conferencing or any other preferred communication channels.
